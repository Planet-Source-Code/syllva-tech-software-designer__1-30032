DESIGNER by Queen City Software

This program has been three years in the making. I have borrowed code from other submissions on PSC, and they are listed in the "Credits.txt" file.

Designer is a web page maker designed to make the writing of raw HTML source easy to create. I wanted it to be easy for anyone to make a web page, even if they are a complete idiot. Typing of HTML code/tags are kept to a minimum, as most people don't want to worry about correct code and where the tags go.

When createing a web page, there is no need to write the <b>, <i>, <u>, etc. tags. Just highlight the text you want, and click the button, the tags insert themselves in the proper places. Same as the font preview - select the text you want, then click on "Insert Font Information" button (the double "T" button on the main window).

The following OCX controls are used in this project, and if you don't have them, let me know and I'll send them to you:

Codemax 2.0 Edit Control
CoolBar Control
MS ADO Data Control 6.0 (Service Pack 4)
MS Internet Controls (the web browser control)
MS Internet Transfer Control 6.0 (Service Pack 4)
MS RichText box
MS Tabbed Dialog Control 6.0 (Service Pack 5)
MS Windows Common Controls 6.0 (Service Pack 4)
MS Windows Common Controls 6.0 - 3 (Service Pack 5)
PicScroll Control

At first I didn't want to release this, but since I lost interest in it, I'm giving it to the PSC community. There is still quite a bit of work to be done on some of the forms, but you can let your imagination run wild ;-). For the most part, it's fully functional in what it can do.

Have fun with it!
