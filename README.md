### Description

A web page editor I've been working on for the past three years. It uses code from other PSC submissions and the main "contributors" are mentioned in the Credits.txt file. This program allows a user to write raw HTML code without the need to worry about correct coding, automatic tag insertion, Web site manager, code formatter, and all kinds of stuff that you'll have to see for yourself :-) This is the project source code, there are some OCX files needed and they are mentioned in the ReadMe file. If you need these OCXs, let me know and I'll send them to you. I will be uploading some of the submissions I got from PSC in a seperate upload so you can see what I used. DO NOT accuse me of stealing anyone's code! I gave credit to the original authors, and if you see any code that looks like yours, let me know what it is and I'll include your name in the credits file. There is still quite a bit of work to be done in this project, but I lost interest in it and uploading it here. have fun!
